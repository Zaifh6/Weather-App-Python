### Features
- Fetches current weather data from an API
- User input for location queries
- Displays temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant data
- Simple and intuitive GUI for easy access

Use this `README.md` to get started and explore the code!

### Built With

* **Python** – A versatile programming language used to handle the core functionality.
* **Tkinter** – The standard GUI toolkit for Python, used to build the graphical interface.
* **Requests** – A Python library for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the API.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Tkinter comes bundled with Python, but you'll need to install the `requests` library separately.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/weather-app.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
  '''sh
  cd weather-app
3.Create a virtual environment
  '''sh
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4.Install the required packages
  '''sh
  pip install requests
